This plugin will lockdown WP Admin. It can hide wp-admin and wp-login as well as add HTTP auth to the login system. It can change the login URL.

== Description ==

This plugin will hide /wp-admin/ when you aren't logged in. If a user isn't logged in and they attempt to access /wp-admin/ directly, they will be unable to and it will return a 404. It can also rename the login URL.

Also, you can add HTTP authentication directly from WP admin and add custom username/password combinations for the HTTP auth, or use the WordPress credentials.

This doesn't touch any .htaccess files or change the WordPress core files. All the CSS/Images under /wp-admin/ are still accessible, just not the .php ones.

If you enable HTTP authencation, it will add HTTP auth to the PHP files in /wp-admin/

== Installation ==
1. Upload `/lockdown-wp-admin/` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Navigate to the "Lockdown WP" menu

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How can we add files to the whitelist to hide from the public eye? We want to have AJAX and use a custom file, but we can't because it hides it from the public. =

You can add a file using the 'no_check_files' filter. Use this:
	`
	function add_my_cool_filter($data)
	{
		//	You have to accept the $data argument or else it will cause a system meltdown ;)
		$data[] = 'my-file-name.php';	//	JUST the file name.
		return $data;
	}
	add_filter('no_check_files', 'add_my_cool_filter');
	`

Simple.

= How can I get back in if the plugin locked me out? =

You can create a .txt file named 'disable_auth.txt' in your wp-content/plugins/lockdown-wp-admin/ folder (The file location would be /wp-content/plugins/lockdown-wp-admin/disable_auth.txt). We don't care about the content but that will disable the HTTP Auth and whatever was locking you out of your site.
